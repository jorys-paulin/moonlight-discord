NVIDIA has stopped supporting GameStream in GeForce Experience, we highly recommend that Moonlight users switch to Sunshine.

**What is Sunshine?**
- *THE* free open source alternative to GeForce Experience
- Works on Windows, Linux and macOS
- Supports NVIDIA, AMD and Intel GPUs

**How to set it up?**
Download: <https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/releases>
Documentation: <https://docs.lizardbyte.dev/projects/sunshine/en/latest/index.html>
Support: <#667129596088418344>

**How does it compare to Geforce Experience?**
- Latency should be about the same (~1 frame behind host)
- It needs a little bit of configuration, which isn't too complicated
- Lots of features and QoL improvements - now and in the future

**Hints:**
- GameStream should be toggled **off** in GeForce Experience (having both running is possible but needs advanced configuration)
- Your Host, Client and Router might need a reboot for remote streaming to work
